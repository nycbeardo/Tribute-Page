            <p>George Washington Carver (c. 1864 to January 5, 1943) was born into slavery and went on to become a
                botanist
                and one of the most prominent scientists and inventors of his time as well as a teacher at the Tuskegee
                Institute.
                Carver devised over 100 products using one major crop — the peanut — including dyes, plastics and
                gasoline.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Carver's work at the helm of the Tuskegee Institute’s agricultural department included groundbreaking
                research on plant biology, much of which focused on the development of new uses for crops including
                peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans and pecans.
                Carver invented hundreds of products, including more than 300 from peanuts (milk, plastics, paints,
                dyes, cosmetics, medicinal oils, soap, ink, wood stains) and 118 from sweet potatoes (molasses, postage
                stamp glue, flour, vinegar and synthetic rubber) and even a type of gasoline. </p>
            <br>
            <p>At the time, cotton production was on the decline in the South; overproduction of a single crop had left
                many fields exhausted and barren. Carver suggested planting peanuts and soybeans, both of which could
                restore nitrogen to the soil, along with sweet potatoes.
                While these crops grew well in southern climates, there was little demand.
                Carver’s inventions and research solved this problem and helped struggling sharecroppers in the South,
                many of them former slaves now faced with necessary cultivation.</p>
